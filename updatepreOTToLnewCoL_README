updateOTToLnewCoL_README

1) Download new col from http://gnaclr.globalnames.org/classification/20

2) Unzip and leave col folder in directory wit the script and a copy of the latest OTToL

3) Run script as python updateOTToLnewCoL.py

The script will do a number of things, including making files that will not be needed, files that 
will need to be checked and a new OTToL with the non-duplicate, non-homonym species with genera
and genera with families.


Run on 080912 and it took ~3hours







Step 1: Parsing and renaming CoL data

provisionallyAcceptedNames and acceptedNames parsed from col taxa.txt
viruses_and_other_prblems: lines that had trouble being renames with our taxonomy--mostly either viruses or hybrids
taxa_provisionallyAcceptedNames and taxa_acceptedNames renamed with accepted higher taxonomy
allCoLrenamed_taxa the two files above concatenated
errorlog - catches errors in major clade/next level taxonomy issues.  So far, hasn't gotten anything but should be checked

Step 2) Finding species to enter, species already in CoL, species that can't be entered for a different reason 

new_sp_2add2OTToL
already_in:lines from species already in OTToL
error_entering: lines that can't be entered - mostly hybrids or subspecies

Step 3) Merging species - then genera - then species again

first pass species outputs 	
	to_merge (first pass species)
	Not Assigned (any lines with Not Assigned--to add later in a different way?)
	genera_2add2OTToL
	
second pass genera - takes genera_2add2OTToL and adds genera - output
stillNotinOTToL - taxa not added because families not found
to_merge - species from above + genera to be added.

Pass 'to_merge' to the add function.  This finds whether any of the species and genera to be added are already in or are homonyms.
If they are, they are written out to a separate file to be looked at, either dups_2check_before_adding2_OTToL080912v2+to_merge or
homonyms_2check_before_adding2_OTToL080912v2+to_merge.

Main output is toAdd_OTToL080912v2+to_merge which gets concatenated to the OTToL and then goes back to merge the remaining species.
